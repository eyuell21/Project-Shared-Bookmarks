# Project: Shared Bookmarks

As developers, we spend a lot of time reading articles on the web and we often want to record useful links to come back to them later. It is fun to share your bookmarks with others so that they can find interesting and useful links too.

Here are some examples of bookmark sites:

- [Jason Kottke](https://kottke.org/)
- [Jeremy Keith](https://adactio.com/links)
- [Andy Baio](https://waxy.org/category/links/)
- [Ali Smith](https://bookmarks.alasdairsmith.co.uk/)
